```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { age: { $gt: 25, $type: "number" } } }, //Added $type check
  { $group: { _id: "$city", averageAge: { $avg: "$age" } } },
  { $sort: { averageAge: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 }
])
```
The solution adds a `$type` operator within the `$match` stage. This ensures that only documents where the 'age' field is of type number are considered.  The `$type` operator's value of "number" specifically targets numeric values, excluding strings or other incompatible data types. This prevents errors during the averaging operation and produces a more reliable result.
