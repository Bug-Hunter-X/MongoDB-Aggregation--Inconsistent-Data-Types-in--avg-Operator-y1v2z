```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } } },
  { $group: { _id: "$city", averageAge: { $avg: "$age" } } },
  { $sort: { averageAge: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 }
])
```
This aggregation pipeline attempts to find the city with the highest average age of users older than 25.  A common error here is referencing a field that doesn't exist or has inconsistent data types, leading to unexpected results or errors. For example, if the 'age' field sometimes contains strings instead of numbers, the `$avg` operator will fail.
